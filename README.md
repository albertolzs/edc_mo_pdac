# A deep clustering model for PDAC patient stratification using multi-omics data

# INF-8605 Interpretability in deep learning

## Abstract

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients face the lowest survival among all cancer patients in Europe. Since Western societies have the highest incidence of pancreatic cancer, it has been projected that PDAC will soon become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The main medical challenges of PDAC are that patients with similar somatic genotypes show a wide range of disease phenotypes, and due to its extreme malignancy, it is difficult to collect large and high-quality datasets that allow systematic analyses of the hidden genotype-phenotype patterns. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently transforming the field of healthcare and represents a promising technology to integrate various datasets and optimize evidence-based decision making. However, we cannot interpret directly how and why a decision has been made by most of machine learning models. In this study, we developed a deep clustering model for PDAC patient stratification. We then exploited it in terms of explainability, aiming to unbox how black-box choices are made. We hope this study helps to introduce AI in real clinical applications, where the knowledge to make decisions is crucial.

## 1. Introduction

Interpretability in deep learning refers to the ability to understand and explain the decisions and predictions made by deep learning models. It plays a crucial role in building trust, understanding model behavior, and identifying potential biases or errors. This project aims to explore various techniques and approaches for interpretability in deep learning models.

## 2. Project overview

For this course, we have focused on multi-omics clustering on pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a complex disease with significant heterogeneity, and multi-omics analysis provides a comprehensive view of the molecular alterations occurring in tumors. This project focuses on applying clustering techniques to identify distinct molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer based on multiple omics data sources.

## 3. Installation

To use the Interpretability in Deep Learning project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/interpretability-in-deep-learning.git

Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the necessary packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Set up your preferred development environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE).

4. Usage

The project provides a set of ready-to-use tools and libraries to interpret deep learning models. Here are the basic steps to utilize the project:

    Load or train your deep learning model using your preferred framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

    Import the relevant modules from the project:

    javascript

from interpretability import interpret_model

Apply the desired interpretability techniques to your model and data using the available functions and methods:

kotlin

    interpret_model.visualize_activations(model, data)
    interpret_model.calculate_feature_importance(model, data)

    Analyze and interpret the outputs generated by the interpretability techniques to gain insights into the model's behavior and predictions.

The project also includes extensive documentation and tutorials to guide users through the different interpretability techniques and their application.
5. Examples

The project's repository includes example notebooks and code snippets to demonstrate the usage of different interpretability techniques. These examples cover a variety of deep learning domains, including image classification, natural language processing, and time series analysis. You can explore these examples to understand how to apply interpretability techniques to your specific use cases.
